Assignment #3 

A Vision For Your City

Over the past few weeks we have shown many ideas and designs for great cities.  This is your opportunity to create ideas about future changes for your city.  We encourage you to think imaginatively – to push the limits of what is possible. But also keep your feet on the ground and deal with real problems and opportunities you see.

So…

Focus on a current problem, a looming problem, an opportunity, a need – or something that represents several of these things – in your city.  

It should be something that design can impact positively.  There are many important problems in cities that require other kinds of changes to society.

Find a site or place where this might be realized.  The vision should be for something larger than an individual building.

Let your imagination run with the possibilities.


You should use no more than 4 pages of A – 4 or 8 ½” x 11” pages as the format for your .pdf or 4 PowerPoint slides  to describe your vision.  You can use a variety of things to explain it:  photos of other places in the world that reflect what you have in mind, drawings or sketches, or images doctored through Photoshop, a montage of fragments drawn from other places in your city and, of course, words.  Don’t worry about whether your skills in portraying the vision are as good as others’ – it’s the ideas that count.

Make sure you address in words (no more than 300) and images:

    What it is?
    What are its essential characteristics?
    Who would need to get involved to realize it?

Upload the 4 pages or the 4 slides describing your vision to the course web site into a single pdf so others can share and discuss your vision more easily. Be sure to include your name of your pdf. We prefer you to use the following lables for your work: familyname_givenname-3.
